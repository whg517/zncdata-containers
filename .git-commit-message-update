Commit messages have been rewritten to follow Conventional Commits format.

Old commits (to be replaced):
- "Initial plan" 
- "Add envsubst to tools image by building from source"
- "Add curl package explicitly to tools image"

New commit:
- "feat(tools): add envsubst command to tools image"

To update the remote branch, a force push is required:
  git push --force-with-lease origin copilot/implement-issues-173

The commit content remains unchanged, only the message format has been updated.
